# P_Q_0
P_Q
Was built as a Visual Studio 2015 C++ project (cannot use Visual Studio 2019 due to issues with CUDA).
Uses no third party libraries (other than STL) but does use 2 open source header files to read/ jpeg or PNG format files.
If building using source file add the following to pre-processor;

STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION

STB_IMAGE_WRITE_IMPLEMENTATION

See screenshot images for example usage and pre-processor entries.
